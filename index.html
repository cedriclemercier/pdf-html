                    Twenty years ago, in our inaugural Corporate Social
                    Responsibility report, we expressed, 'Greenify has the
                    chance to set the standard. Our obligation begins with being
                    answerable to Greenify stakeholders – our associates,
                    clients, investors, suppliers, local residents, and others –
                    communicating transparently about our business practices and
                    performance. ' Greenify has consistently stood out as a
                    company with a distinct purpose, where we collaborate to
                    generate a positive impact globally. We pursue ambitious
                    objectives for our associates, our communities, and our
                    planet with deliberate, transparent, and responsible
                    actions. As we present the company's environmental and
                    social progress in FY21, we take pride in the strides we've
                    made and remain committed to the belief that we can lead
                    with a human-centric approach, extending beyond mere profit
                    motives. This report delineates the objectives we've
                    established and underscores the collective impact we can
                    achieve – when we support our associates, engage with our
                    clients and communities, and hold ourselves mutually
                    accountable. Like many organizations, our company is also
                    confronting new challenges in an evolving landscape – the
                    ongoing repercussions of COVID-19, heightened social and
                    political unrest, unionization efforts, and stakeholders
                    demanding increased accountability from corporations.

                    There have been instances where we've fallen short of our
                    aspirations. However, we maintain transparency about our
                    shortcomings while continuously striving to seize the
                    opportunities before us, guided by our Mission and Values,
                    and always aspiring to surpass the expectations of our
                    associates and customers. Envisioning a future where our
                    people and communities are never left behind but continually
                    propelled forward. A future where our planet is nurtured,
                    and we generate value not only for our company but for the
                    collective success of all our stakeholders. This is our role
                    and responsibility, collectively.
